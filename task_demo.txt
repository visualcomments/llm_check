You are a senior Python engineer. Implement a very simple algorithm in Python: find the maximum value in a list using a single linear scan.

## Task
Write a standalone Python module that defines:
    def find_max(nums: list[int]) -> int:

## Constraints & Behavior
- If nums is empty, raise ValueError("empty sequence").
- Support negative numbers, duplicates, and single-element lists.
- Do NOT use built-ins that solve the task directly (e.g., max(), sorted(), numpy).
- Time complexity must be O(n).
- Extra space must be O(1) (aside from simple variables).
- Do NOT print anything. No file/network I/O. No external imports.

## Code quality
- Include type hints and a clear docstring (describe behavior and examples).
- Keep the implementation short and readable; add minimal comments.
- Follow PEP 8.

## Answer format
- The final answer MUST be a single Python code block with no extra commentary.
